# Player 1 picks a leader
# Player 2 picks a leader
# Each leader is associated with certain units 
# For example, Hannibal would have ranged elephant archers (ranged)
# All units are based around melee, ranged, cavalry
# Certain units have weaknesses to the other units 

# Melee beats cavalry 
# Ranged beats melee
# Cavalry beats ranged 

# By 'beat', we only mean 'dmg' points 
# Certain units start with certain health points

# Ex: Leader 1's melee units are extremely durable (145 hp) vs another leader's which are mediocre (85 hp)

# Random weather events help decide advantages and disadvantages 

# Typhoon will disadvtange cavalry, advantage ranged
# Hurricane will disadvantage ranged, advtange melee
# Earthquake will disadvantage melee, advrange cavalry
